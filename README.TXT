ChalkBoard: An Intuitive Computer Algebra System

The purpose of this project is to design, using object-oriented principles,
an intuitive and multi-purpose Computer Algebra System. This project is
intended to be useful particularly in STEM education and engineering. 


The key features of such a Computer Algebra System include:

- A simplified user experience
- Useful functionality for both computation and learning
- Portability and integratability with programs which may require algebraic computation

Thank you for looking!
